The MaxDebt method calculates the maximum debt on any given date based on a list of Customer objects. Each Customer object contains information about billing and payment dates along with payment amounts. The method iterates through each date from the billing dates and sums up the debt for each date, identifying the date with the highest cumulative debt.
